Introduction 
The Test Plan has been created to communicate the test approach to team members. It includes the objectives, scope, schedule, risks and approach.  This document will clearly identify what the test deliverables will be and what is out of scope.

1.1	Objectives
  To validate the quality of the Math Service using HTTP API specification and using Spring Boot      and initial release of the service to the customers.

Services team project with functionality to create and store service tests.  This will allow the test team to start transferring tests over to the new system.  Must have functionality is considered more important than the delivery date in this project.

2	Scope
The initial phase will include all ‘must have’ requirements. At the end of Phase 1, a tester must be able to:
1.	Create the test suites for the API’s
2.	Execute the test cases created within test suites
3.	Enter results and appropriate comments
4.	Prepare test results and bug report documents
